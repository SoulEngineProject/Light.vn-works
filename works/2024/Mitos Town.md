```
Amanda is on her way to her friend's wedding when her car suddenly breaks down at the side of the road.
With no cellphone and no tools to repair her car she begins to panic, but soon discovers there's a town not very far from her, Mitos Town.
Maybe they can help her there? Well on her way a big guy threaten her, telling her not to go to the town.
Then, when she finally got there the locals... They were acting a little weird.
But surely it will be fine, surely she'll find some help. It's not like this is going to be her last stop.
