A vampire themed visual novel that takes place in the 80’s, in which
you play as Inez, a vampire who woke up one night to find out her
longtime companion, Heather, had left her. Or did she? When Inez
starts to wonder what could’ve made Heather take off on her own,
she questions some of their acquaintances from the bar, Sangria,
about what each of them believe to have caused this. The owner Jo;
the drummer, Alec; the bartender, Loretta and the private detective
Bernard, they all have their own theories. Now Inez must decide who
to believe if she wants to find her beloved Heather again.
